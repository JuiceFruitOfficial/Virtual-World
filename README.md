# Virtual World
Our virtual world is a project to serve as a platform for others to build their own games, simulations, universal apps and more!

# The Core Concepts
There are 3 clans that the players can join: Wizards and Witches, Barbarians and Nerds.
There will be 2 places that are made by us, the developers and the rest will be made by the players. Those developer-generated places are the starting island featuring a hotel and some shops, and SkyCity, a city in the sky where the players can build their own houses and digital companies.

# Technologies we are using

## Voxelcss
Voxelcss is a CSS-based 3D-engine that we are using.
